get_institution.pl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Skript collects data (institution.xml) from eduroam participants and
generates whole NRO institution.xml file.

Usage:
  ./bin/get_institution.pl --CFG cfg/get_institution.cfg

The script will try to download all URLs defined in configuration
file. It will verify them by XSD and check whatever they contains only
listed realms. If everything is ok then final institution.xml file is
published.


institution.xml => google kml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An ugly but fast trick for converting final institution.xml into kml
file for google maps:

bin/GPS2google.pl institution.xml |\
	sed 's/encoding="UTF-8"/encoding="ISO-8859-2"/' |\
	sed "s/GLOB.*//" |\
	xsltproc bin/GPS2google.xsl -  > institution.kml
